# hello-world
Just my first repository.
Im decently new to coding, but I have had an interest in it for a while and I thought it might be time for me to give it a shot. I know some Java (hoping to learn more), and a very small amount of C# Unity. If I would describe myself as anything right now I would say a coding enthusiest, not much more than that. Always open to tips and pointers.
